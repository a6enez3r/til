# Go Test Cache

As part of Go 1.10 the test command provided by the Go language will cache test results. If the test executable and command line match a previous run and the files and environment consulted by that run have not changed, `go test` will simply print the previous test output, replacing the elapsed time with the string.

You can turn this behavior off by

- using `count`
```
    go test -count=1
```

- using `GOCACHE` environment variable (pre Go 1.10)
```
    GOCACHE=off go test
```

or alternatively you can clean the cached results

```
    go clean -testcache && go test 
```
